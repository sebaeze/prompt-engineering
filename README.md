# Prompt Engineering

The purpose of this repo is to help you to enhance your prompting skills

## What is a prompt in the context of AI ?

A prompt is the input and/or instruction given to a AI Model in order to guide Its response.

## Why Should I learn about prompt engineering ?

Refining your prompts will enhance your deliverables and productivity by leveraging the AI. The better you guide the AI Model's responses, the more your work will be boosted.

## What Can I do using prompt ?

- Shape the behaviour of the AI Model.
- Format the output / response from the AI Model.
- Get accurate responses.
- Minimize incorrect responses.

## Prompt techniques

### Steps for improving your prompt

- Define your objective clearly: Be specific about the purpose and desired output.
- Provide context: Include relevant information or background.
- Use clear and simple language: Look for the right wording, don't be ambiguous.
- Specify the format or style.
- Ask direct questions or give explicit instructions.
- Iterate and Refine: Test your prompt and modify It in order to achieve your goal.

### Zero-Shot

This technique do not provide context either examples in the query or prompt. As a result, the AI Model will entirely rely on the pre-trained data.

Recommended for:
- Simple tasks that do not require dinamic information.
- Experimentation with LLM.
- General knowledge tasks.
